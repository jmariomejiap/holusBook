# Holus Book

**Holus Book** is an App that I developed as a side project to share some vegetarians recipes  with my friends (meat and Non-Meat eaters) with the hope of solving the “what can I cook for you” dilemma. 

**Holus Book** was built using React Native, React Navigation, Redux, Typescript and AWS S3 Bucket.
